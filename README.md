The purpose of this GitHub org is to organize our coding demos used for Intro and AP final projects. The coding demos can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MbpFhCoB3iH4-fXEYK06GvZBlF0bVhj5?usp=sharing

For each demo, we need to:
1) Create a repository in the format:
    Demo-[Intro/AP]-[Swing/Processing]-[DemoName]
    If the demo is not intro or ap specific, or is not swing or processing specific (like the mp3 demo), then just leave these portions out.
    
3) Put an Eclipse Project into that repository. Make sure the project is set to use JDK version 1.8.

4) Add all source/data from the zip file into the Eclipse Project. Run it and test functionality.

5) Commit and push to the repo.
